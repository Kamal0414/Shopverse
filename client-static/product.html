                    <p>The Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones are designed to offer advanced noise cancellation, exceptional sound quality, and smart listening features that adapt to your environment. They incorporate dual noise sensor technology, featuring two microphones on each earcup, which captures ambient noise and passes the data to the HD Noise Cancelling Processor QN1. This processor applies noise cancelling processing in real time to a range of acoustic environments, optimizing sound at high altitudes and tailoring noise cancellation to individual users based on their unique sonic characteristics caused by head size, glasses, and hair</p>
